I am a doctoral candidate in Computer Science at the University of Iowa, where I'm a
member of the [Computational Logic Center](https://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/site/). I
like (functional) programming languages, semantics, and type theory.


My active research interest is in expressing [extensible data
types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08759) using [row
types](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290325) (with Dr. J. Garrett Morris,
Co-Advisor). My current work is in expanding the expressivity of
[System RÏ‰](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08759), a higher-order row calculus with
label-generic combinators.

I am also very interested in:

- various applications of row type systems, e.g. [session types](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/papers/fst-extended.pdf), and [algebraic effects & handlers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976022.2976033);
- language mechanization in Agda, by way of both [shallow
embeddings](https://github.com/IaFP/ROmega-ICFP23) (with denotational semantics)
and [deep embeddings](https://github.com/IaFP/System-F-to-R-Omega/) (with operational semantics);
- and using [Mendler-style recursion schemes](https://github.com/astump/dc-recursion-examples) to enforce *type-based* termination checking in total languages (e.g. [Coq](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3571196)).
